# SVG Effects Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **README.md Image Path Issues**
- **Problem**: Snake SVG images were referencing absolute GitHub URLs pointing to `ychun816/ychun816` repository
- **Solution**: Changed to relative paths (e.g., `./assets/github-snake.svg`) so they work correctly in this repository

### 2. **Duplicate Snake Animation**
- **Problem**: README had duplicate snake animation references
- **Solution**: Removed the duplicate snake image reference

### 3. **Workflow Configuration**
- **Problem**: The snake generation workflow had incorrect parameters for Platane/snk@v3
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed the `github_user_name` parameter to use hardcoded `ychun816` instead of `${{ github.repository_owner }}`
  - Moved `GITHUB_TOKEN` to the `env` section where it belongs for Platane/snk@v3

## Files Modified

1. **README.md**
   - Updated snake SVG paths from absolute URLs to relative paths
   - Removed duplicate snake animation reference

2. **.github/workflows/github-stats.yml**
   - Fixed snake generation action parameters
   - Proper token configuration

## How to Trigger SVG Generation

You can manually trigger the workflows to generate the SVG files:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Actions" tab
3. Select the workflow you want to run:
   - "Generate Stats Images" - for snake animations
   - "GitHub-Profile-3D-Contrib" - for 3D contribution graph
   - "Metrics" - for GitHub metrics
4. Click "Run workflow"

Or just wait for the scheduled runs:
- Stats Images: Daily at midnight UTC
- 3D Contrib: Daily at 6 PM UTC
- Metrics: Daily at midnight UTC

## Expected Output

After workflows run successfully, you should see:
- `assets/github-snake.svg` - Light mode snake animation
- `assets/github-snake-dark.svg` - Dark mode snake animation
- `profile-3d-contrib/profile-night-rainbow.svg` - 3D contribution graph (already exists)
- `github-metrics.svg` - GitHub metrics
- `metrics.plugin.isocalendar.svg` - Calendar heatmap
- `metrics.plugin.languages.svg` - Language statistics

## Notes

- The 3D contribution graph already exists and works correctly
- Make sure your repository is public or workflows have proper permissions
- The workflows will automatically commit generated files back to the repository
